# Notes
 Reasons to choose and re write that documentation.
 1. Steps to Follow: The original content lacked clear, sequential steps and adherence to documentation standards and technical  documentation best industry practices.
 2. Verb Usage: Each step in technical documentation must start with a verb for the following processes (e.g., Install, Download, Add), ensuring clarity and avoiding redundancy.
 3. Clarity and Professionalism: I added standardized format to enhance clarity and professionalism by providing a structured and easy-to-follow  guide for users.
 4. Content Organization: The content was highly disorganized and lacked clarity from the outset. There was no clear structure or guideline to effectively divide and explain the information, leading to confusion and inefficiency. A more methodical approach with a well-defined hierarchy and focused content is essential for providing a professional and coherent user experience.
